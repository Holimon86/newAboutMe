        <h3>Three things I have learned today that has tremendously impacted my journey into web development are;</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Pushing documents and elements to gitHub.</li><br>
            <li>Macs are systemically trash when used for web development outside of the astethic platform usage.</li><br>
            <li>I shall be using more than one monitor moving forward!</li>
